## About Me

My name is Aloe, and I'm a **creative technologist** hailing from the SF Bay Area. With experience across a variety of industries, I've worked at big companies like **Google** and startups like **Reddit**. Originally, I graduated with a degree in theater from **UCLA**. Since then I've sought to help people connect to the things they care about most through storytelling, curiosity, and intentionality. When I'm not building, you'll find me exploring the green **PNW** with my corgi **Milkshake** 🐕
