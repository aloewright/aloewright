## About Me
My name is Aloe, and I'm a **creative technologist** hailing from the SF Bay Area. With experience across a variety of industries, I've worked at big companies like **Google** and startups like **Reddit**. Originally, I graduated with a degree in theater from **UCLA**. Since then I've sought to help people connect to the things they care about the most by building innovative products that seamlessly coalesce with a consumer's narrative about whom they are and how they define themselves in the world. When I'm not building, you'll find me exploring the green **PNW** with my corgi **Milkshake** 🐕 Feel free to reach out about any open source projects or research opportunities 😊 

I spend most of my time in **Warp** ꩜ coding with:
